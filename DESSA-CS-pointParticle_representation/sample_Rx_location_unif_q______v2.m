% REJECTION SAMPLING USED TO OBTAIN rA_sample, thetaA_sample
% The proposal distribution q is UNIFORM DISTRIBUTION 

% Inputs: the A particle is the reactant with the SMALLER diffusion sphere
%         at reaction time. The B particle is that with the larger diff
%         sphere at reaction time.
%         <d> is the distance between the last known positions of A and B.
%         <t_elapsed_a> is the time elapsed between A's last state update and
%         the current reaction time. Analogous for B.

% Why use t_elapsed_a and t_elapsed_b instead of the waiting time?
% There are 2 situations to consider.
% Situation 1: A and B's states were last updated at the same time. They
%              both began diffusing at the same time. 
% Situation 2: Reaction A+B was evaluated when one of the particles had
%              already been diffusing (one particle has t_offset > 0, the
%              other has t_offset == 0)
% At most one of the particles can have a positive offset since we only
% consider reactions (to add to the PQ) involving a particle that was just 
% updated.
% In situation 2, the lesser of t_elapsed_a and t_elapsed_b is the 
% wait_time.


% 1. Compute diffusion sphere radii Ra,Rb at moment of bimolecular reaction
%    i.e. the "observed" diffusion sphere radii
Ra = n_sigma.*(6.*Da_actual.*t_elapsed_a)^(1./2);  
Rb = n_sigma.*(6.*Db_actual.*t_elapsed_b)^(1./2);


% "A" labeled the particle with the smaller diffusion sphere just before
% the wait_time was sampled. "B" labeled the particle with the larger
% diffusion sphere.
% HOWEVER, now the time each particle has been diffusing, t_elapsed_x
% includes that wait_time and the labels may no longer be appropriate.
% Switch them if necessary.

    Rb = n_sigma*(6*Db_actual*t_elapsed_b)^(1/2);
end

assert(Ra<=Rb);
    
    
% 2. Using d, Ra, Rb, infer Case (i.e. 1, 2, 3/4, or 5).
if d > Ra && d > Rb
    caseNum = 1; % Overlap Volume contains neither initial position of A nor B.
    
elseif d > Ra && d <= Rb && 2*Ra > Rb
    caseNum = 2; % Overlap Volume contains initial position of A, but not of B.
                 % Also, diameter of A is greater than radius of B.
elseif d > Ra && d <= Rb && 2*Ra <= Rb
    caseNum = 3; % Overlap Volume contains initial position of A, but not of B.
                 % Diameter of A is now less than radius of B (B grows fast).    
elseif d <= Ra && d <= Rb && Ra + d > Rb
    caseNum = 4; % Overlap Volume contains initial positions of A and of B.
                 % Part of the A sphere is still outside the B sphere.
else
    caseNum = 5;
end
    
% 3. If the diffusion spheres of molecules A and B started growing at the
%    same absolute time (no time offset, both states were last updated at 
%    the same time), use their actual Da and Db values.
%    However, if there was some offset, the actual Da,Db values would not 
%    lead to the observed Ra,Rb values. Therefore, infer temporary Da,Db 
%    values from the observed Ra,Rb at reaction time.
